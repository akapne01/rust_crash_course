/// Methods are defined within the context of a struct, and their first paramter
/// is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
/// 'self' is used in the method signature only when the method transforms 'self' into something
/// else and you want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.
/// '&mut self' would be a parameter, if we would want to write to the struct.
/// Method can have the same name as one of the struct's fields.
/// When you call a method with object.something(), Rust automatically adds in &, &mut, or * so object
/// matches the signature of the method. In other words, the following are the same:
///     p1.distance(&p2); is the same as (&p1).distance(&p2);
///  This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiverâ€”the type of self.
/// Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (&self),
/// mutating (&mut self), or consuming (self).
///  The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice.
/// 
/// ### Structs ###
/// - Allows to define new types that are meaningul for your domain.
/// - Allows to group associated pieces of data together.
/// - in 'impl' blocks can define functions that are associated with your type, and methods are kind of associated function
/// that let you specify the behaviour that instances of your structs have. 
/// - Structs are not the only way to create custom types. There are enums as well.

// Creates an implementation block.
// '&self' is short for: 'self: &Self'
// Method borrows the self object, so we need to use '&self'.
// We don't want to take ownership, we just want to read the data
// in the struct, not to write to it.
// All functions in 'impl' block are called associated functions becasue they are associated
// with the type named after impl. We can define assoc. f(x) that don't have 'self' as their
// first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don't need an instance of the type
// to work with. Assoc. f(x) are often used for constructors that will return a new instance
// of a struct.
